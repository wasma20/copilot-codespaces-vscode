        <h2>What is image processing?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:left;">Digital Image processing is the class of methods that deal with manipulating digital images through the use of computer algorithms. It is an essential preprocessing step in many applications, such as face recognition, object detection, and image compression.<br>
            Image processing is done to enhance an existing image or to sift out important information from it. This is important in several Deep Learning-based Computer Vision applications, where such preprocessing can dramatically boost the performance of a model. Manipulating images, for example, adding or removing objects to images, is another application, especially in the entertainment industry.<br>       
            This paper addresses a medical image segmentation problem, where the authors used image inpainting in their preprocessing pipeline for the removal of artifacts from dermoscopy images. Examples of this operation are shown below.</br></p>
